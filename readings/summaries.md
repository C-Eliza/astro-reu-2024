# Summaries of papers:

This overview piece is being created so that I can track my understanding of each background paper that I need to research, in addition to having something to touch back on in case I want a quick refresher on each paper. This should also help in the future when it comes to tracking what papers influenced my decisions that I make during the duration of this project.
