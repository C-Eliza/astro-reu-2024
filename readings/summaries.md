# Summaries of papers:

This overview piece is being created so that I can track my understanding of each background paper that I need to research, in addition to having something to touch back on in case I want a quick refresher on each paper. This should also help in the future when it comes to tracking what papers influenced my decisions that I make during the duration of this project.

## Papers on HII regions
### Discovery of a New Population of Galactic HII Regions with Ionized Gas Velocity Gradients
*DOI:* 10.3847/1538-4357/ac1db3
*Purpose:* Works to understand the reason that there appear to be velocity gradients in observed HII regions.
*Summary:* First, it makes note that 42% of observed regions contain a velocity gradient between 5 and 200 km/s. It then goes on to simulate these regions as if they contain either an outflow or a rotation. Comparing the sample data for this paper to the simulations used, it seems to suggest that rotation may be a good model for the HII regions.
*Significance:* Was previous working model before the latest data showed more variation in velocities. My work will be closely building off of this previous work.

### The SOFIA FEEDBACK Legacy Survey Dynamics and Mass Ejection in the Bipolar HII Region RCW 36
*DOI:* 10.3847/1538-4357/ac8052
*Purpose:* Summary paper of findings from a SOFIA observing run on RCW 36 in the OI and CII frequencies.
*Summary:* 
*Significance:* This region is further investigated in the latest data. 

## Papers on turbulence
### Interstellar Turbulence I: Observations and Processes
*DOI:* 10.1146/annurev.astro.41.011802.094859
*Purpose:* The purpose of this paper is to introduce the audience to turbulence in the ISM. In particular, this part 1 has been created to discuss the cooler ISM, how we check for turbulence, and highlighting the results we have gotten from it.
*Summary:*
